Map (HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, ConcurrentHashMap)
Beginner (10-15 assignments):

1 Create a HashMap and perform put, get, remove operations

2 Iterate through all keys, values, and entries of a Map

3 Check if a key or value exists in a Map

4 Copy all mappings from one Map to another

5 Remove all entries from a Map that satisfy a condition

6 Count frequency of characters in a string using HashMap

7 Find the key with the highest value in a Map

8 Sort a Map by keys and by values

9 Check if two Maps are equal

10 Create a nested Map structure (Map<String, Map<String, Integer>>)

Intermediate (15-20 assignments):
11. Store custom objects as keys in HashMap with proper hashCode()/equals()
12. Implement a simple in-memory cache using LinkedHashMap
13. Group objects by a property using Map (e.g., group employees by department)
14. Find the first non-repeating character in string using LinkedHashMap
15. Implement a word counter for large text files
16. Create a method to merge two Maps with the same keys
17. Implement a simple database index using TreeMap
18. Find all pairs in array that sum to target using HashMap
19. Design a voting system that counts votes for candidates
20. Implement LRU Cache using LinkedHashMap

Advanced/Architect (15-20 assignments):
21. Implement a thread-safe cache with TTL (Time To Live) using ConcurrentHashMap
22. Create a custom HashMap with fixed size and collision handling
23. Design a distributed session storage system interface using Map
24. Implement a multi-valued Map (Map<K, Collection<V>>)
25. Create a Map that maintains access order statistics
26. Benchmark HashMap vs TreeMap vs ConcurrentHashMap for various operations
27. Implement a persistent Map using disk storage
28. Design a rate limiter using Map to track request counts
29. Create a Map with weak references for cache implementation
30. Implement
